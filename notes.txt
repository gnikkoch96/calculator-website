1. Create functions for all basic math operators
    a. add
    b. subtract
    3. multiply
    4. divide

2. Create a function operate(arg1, arg2) that will decide which functions to call (from step 1)

3. Create an html skeleton with buttons for each digit, all the basic math operators, and an event listener when someone presses the "=" key. Also include a way to display the result and add a 'clear' button.


Brainstorm:
1. Make row 5 flex, and have 0 have a higher flex value so that it scales


Notes
1. I am not seeing that to have a good commit message, you have to be specific as possible as what you pushed so that it is easier to see what someone has done. "organized layout" is not as helpful as "used flex to organize buttons in rows'





function equals(){
    // store num2
    num2 = Number(calcDisplay.textContent);

    // calculate and append to display 
    let result = operate(operator, num1, num2);
    console.log(result);

    calcDisplay.textContent = result;

    // store to num1;
    num1 = result;

    // reset flags
    pressedDot = false;
    pressedOperator = false;
}
