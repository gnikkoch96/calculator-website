1. Create functions for all basic math operators
    a. add
    b. subtract
    3. multiply
    4. divide

2. Create a function operate(arg1, arg2) that will decide which functions to call (from step 1)

3. Create an html skeleton with buttons for each digit, all the basic math operators, and an event listener when someone presses the "=" key. Also include a way to display the result and add a 'clear' button.


Brainstorm:
1. Make row 5 flex, and have 0 have a higher flex value so that it scales


Notes
1. I am not seeing that to have a good commit message, you have to be specific as possible as what you pushed so that it is easier to see what someone has done. "organized layout" is not as helpful as "used flex to organize buttons in rows'
2. Next time I should clarify specific tasks that I need to do so I can start commiting in increments and providing better comments on said commits



1. User presses a number1
2. User presses an operator
    a. pressedOperator = true
3. User presses a number2
    b. pressedOperator = false
4. User presses an operator
    b. pressedOperator = true;

How do we know if the user has pressed their second number? 


tasks
1. fix overflowing number   
    a. I want to make it so that it expands the display box
7. (bug) pressing = shouldn't work unless an expression was made
8. (bug) After pressing =, instead of replacing the number on the next input it appends to it
